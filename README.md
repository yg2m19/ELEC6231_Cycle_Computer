# cycle_computer


In this project, the cycle computer will be designed for hardware-only using AMS 0.35Âµm CMOS.To achieve the basic functions of the cycle computer,two DRV5021 hall effect sensors can be set to frank and crank of bicycle respectively,which can measure the time between magnetic threshold operate point(BOP) and release point(BRP). The information of each function can be displayed on the LED.
